## About
I am a dedicated iOS Developer with one year of professional experience in building robust and user-friendly mobile applications. My expertise lies in leveraging both Swift to create seamless and efficient applications. I have a strong proficiency in SwiftUI and UIKit, enabling me to design and implement intuitive user interfaces.

I am skilled in working with various frameworks and tools such as Core Data for data management, RxSwift and Combine for reactive programming, and Alamofire for networking. My development approach is grounded in best practices, including Test-Driven Development (TDD), unit testing, and snapshot testing, ensuring high-quality and maintainable code. Additionally, I have experience in building programmatic UI, allowing for dynamic and customizable interfaces.

I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and continuously improving my skills to deliver innovative and high-performing applications.
