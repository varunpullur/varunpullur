## About
Dedicated iOS Developer building robust and user-friendly mobile applications. Leveraging both Swift, I create seamless and efficient applications. I have a strong proficiency in SwiftUI and UIKit, enabling me to design and implement intuitive user interfaces.

I am skilled in working with various frameworks and tools such as Core Data for data management, RxSwift and Combine for reactive programming, and Alamofire for networking. My development approach is grounded in best practices, including Test-Driven Development (TDD), unit testing, and snapshot testing, ensuring high-quality and maintainable code. Additionally, I have experience in building programmatic UI, allowing for dynamic and customizable interfaces.
